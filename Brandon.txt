This semester in Data Sciece, the topics challenged students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. We covered topics such as data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas package, data visualization using the Matplotlib package, web scraping, and more advanced data structures. Project-oriented group assignments were a large component of the course.

Brandon, this semester, you were strong in learning indicator 3: "Design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems", and learning indicator 6: "effectively communicate programming solutions to others". You demonstrated these strengths in the Partner Problem Set and Unit 1 Test. Good job! You should be proud of your hard work.

Brandon, some areas of growth for you in the next semester include learning indicator 1: "Identify/characterize/define a programming problem", as well as learning indicator 7: "work collaboratively to write modular code on larger projects". Moving forward, I encourage you to be open to talking with your classmates to overcome challenges in both your own and your classmates code.

Brandon, you recieved test scores of 98, 93, and 83 for an average score of 91 across the three units. You struggled in the following units: U3. Come meet with me if you feel you still need support on these topics. Brandon, I have noticed that your grades within the units have been decreasing. I'd love to see improvement moving forward. Please reach out to me for support. For the work you have shown in this class, you recieve a grade of A-. Excellent work, Brandon! You are able to overcome obstacles and show a thorough understanding of the material. Brandon, it has been a pleasure working with you this semester and look forward to more in the future! You'll have the opportunity to come up with some original ideas for some games and then work with a team to code these ideas into reality.
