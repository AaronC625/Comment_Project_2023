This semester in Data Sciece, the topics challenged students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. We covered topics such as data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas package, data visualization using the Matplotlib package, web scraping, and more advanced data structures. Project-oriented group assignments were a large component of the course.

Emma, this semester, you were strong in learning indicator 4: "Express creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts", and learning indicator 7: "work collaboratively to write modular code on larger projects". You demonstrated these strengths in the Unit 2 Problem Set and Semester Final. Good job! You should be proud of your hard work.

Emma, some areas of growth for you in the next semester include learning indicator 3: "Design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems", as well as learning indicator 6: "effectively communicate programming solutions to others". Moving forward, I encourage you to collaborate more with your peers when designing test solutions in your programs. 

Emma, you recieved test scores of 50, 45, and 61 for an average score of 52 across the three units. You struggled in the following units: U1. U2. U3. Come meet with me if you feel you still need support on these topics. For the work you have shown in this class, you recieve a grade of F. Emma, it has been a pleasure working with you this semester and look forward to more in the future! You'll have the opportunity to come up with some original ideas for some games and then work with a team to code these ideas into reality.
