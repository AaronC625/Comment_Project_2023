This semester in Data Sciece, the topics challenged students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. We covered topics such as data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas package, data visualization using the Matplotlib package, web scraping, and more advanced data structures. Project-oriented group assignments were a large component of the course.

Barack, this semester, you were strong in learning indicator 1: "Identify/characterize/define a programming problem", and learning indicator 4: "Express creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts". You demonstrated these strengths in the Semester Final and Unit 2 Problem Set. Good job! You should be proud of your hard work.

Barack, some areas of growth for you in the next semester include learning indicator 2: "Understand and be able to use a variety of data types, control structures, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques in their programming", as well as learning indicator 3: "Design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems". Moving forward, come to office hours if you are sruggling with new material and don't be afraid to make mistakes.

Barack, you recieved test scores of 99, 82, and 90 for an average score of 90 across the three units. You struggled in the following units: U2. Come meet with me if you feel you still need support on these topics. For the work you have shown in this class, you recieve a grade of A-. Barack, it has been a pleasure working with you this semester and look forward to more in the future! You'll have the opportunity to come up with some original ideas for some games and then work with a team to code these ideas into reality.
