This semester in Data Sciece, the topics challenged students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. We covered topics such as data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas package, data visualization using the Matplotlib package, web scraping, and more advanced data structures. Project-oriented group assignments were a large component of the course.

Callie, this semester, you were strong in learning indicator 1: "Identify/characterize/define a programming problem", and learning indicator 8: "Complete assignments on time". You demonstrated these strengths in the Unit 2 Problem Set and Partner Project. Good job! You should be proud of your hard work.

Callie, some areas of growth for you in the next semester include learning indicator 3: "Design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems", as well as learning indicator 7: "work collaboratively to write modular code on larger projects". Moving forward, complete your assignments on time!

Callie, you recieved test scores of 100, 98, and 92 for an average score of 96 across the three units. You did great in all three units. Keep up the good work! Callie, I have noticed that your grades within the units have been decreasing. I'd love to see improvement moving forward. Please reach out to me for support. For the work you have shown in this class, you recieve a grade of A. Excellent work, Callie! You are able to overcome obstacles and show a thorough understanding of the material. Callie, it has been a pleasure working with you this semester and look forward to more in the future! You'll have the opportunity to come up with some original ideas for some games and then work with a team to code these ideas into reality.
