This semester in Data Sciece, the topics challenged students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. We covered topics such as data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas package, data visualization using the Matplotlib package, web scraping, and more advanced data structures. Project-oriented group assignments were a large component of the course.

Easton, this semester, you were strong in learning indicator 5: "Identify and repair coding errors in a program", and learning indicator 8: "Complete assignments on time". You demonstrated these strengths in the Unit 3 Problem Set and Unit 1 Test. Good job! You should be proud of your hard work.

Easton, some areas of growth for you in the next semester include learning indicator 2: "Understand and be able to use a variety of data types, control structures, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques in their programming", as well as learning indicator 6: "effectively communicate programming solutions to others". Moving forward, don't be afraid to speak up in class and share your code.

Easton, you recieved test scores of 95, 95, and 100 for an average score of 96 across the three units. You did great in all three units. Keep up the good work! For the work you have shown in this class, you recieve a grade of A. Excellent work, Easton! You are able to overcome obstacles and show a thorough understanding of the material. Easton, it has been a pleasure working with you this semester and look forward to more in the future! You'll have the opportunity to come up with some original ideas for some games and then work with a team to code these ideas into reality.
